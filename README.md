# Number guessing game
a very simple implementation of number guessing game using Go.

## How it works
1. generates a random number
2. gets a fact about that number from [numbersapi](numbersapi.com).
3. checks with the user input.

## How to run
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nsltharaka/guess-game.git
$ cd guess-game
$ go run . --limit 100
```
